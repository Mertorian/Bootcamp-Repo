## Data Structures Excursion

Arrays: An array is a collection of elements such as a list of numbers or a list of names.

Stacks: A stack is a collection of elements that supports two main operations:

-   push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and
-   pop, which removes the top element from the stack.

Stacks are used to implement algorithms that require last-in, first-out (LIFO) behavior, such as depth-first search.

Queues: A queue is a collection of elements that supports two main operations:

-   enqueue, which adds an element to the back of the queue, and
-   dequeue, which removes the front element from the queue.

Queues are used to implement algorithms that require first-in, first-out (FIFO) behavior, such as breadth-first search.
